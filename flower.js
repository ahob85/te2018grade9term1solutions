  In an infinite loop, prompt the player to guess a letter. The program can exit
  the loop only if the player's guess is "valid", which means it passes all
  three of these conditions:
   1) The length of the guess must be exactly 1.
   2) The guess cannot be a letter they have already guessed (alreadyGuessed is
      an array passed into the function).
   3) The guess must be a letter in the English alphabet.

  Return the guess if it is valid. If a guess does not satisfy a condition,
  print a message communicating this to the player. For example, if the player
  enters "abc" or "", they have failed condition #1, so you should print
  something like, "Please guess one letter at a time.".

  Valid guesses should include both uppercase and lowercase letters. To make
  things easier on yourself, try setting the player's guess to all lowercase
  before validating it against the three conditions.

  Get a player's guess by calling getGuess(). If the guess appears in the secret
  word, append that letter to correctLetters. Otherwise append it to
  missedLetters.

  Note that getGuess() has a parameter called alreadyGuessed, which prevents the
  player from guessing the same letter more than once. When calling getGuess(),
  you need to pass an array of guesses the user has already made, which is
  simply a concatenation of missedLetters and correctLetters arrays.

  You can concatenate arrays using the array.concat() method. For example:

  let array1 = ["a", "b", "c"];
  let array2 = ["d", "e", "f"];
  let array3 = array1.concat(array2);

  The value of array3 is ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"].

  -If they have won, print a congratulatory message, then call
   processGameOver().
  -Otherwise, if they have lost, print the board one last time. Then print a
   message telling them they have run out of guesses, along with another message
   telling them what the secret word was. Finally, call processGameOver().
  -If they have neither won nor lost, do nothing.

  To check for a win, you should see if each letter in the secretWord string is
  contained in the correctLetters array. You can do this with a for loop that
  passes through the length of secretWord, but exits the moment it finds a
  letter that isn't contained in correctLetters. This is the trickiest part of
  this project and requires you to think out of the box a bit (at least, if
  you want to do it the "neat" way).
